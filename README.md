*Motion cancellation system for Oculus rift*

Vection is the next key to bring a better sense of presence in the virtual reality world. Motion simulators have been around for a while but the Oculus rift currently doesn't integrate nicely with them. Because the Oculus rift tracks the head movements relative to the ground and not relative to the player seat.
VectionVR motion simulator Stabilizer brings this extra step to the Oculus rift. For more information please visit [Vection VR website](http://www.vectionvr.com/)
